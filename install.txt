TRUST GATEWAY 1.0 EARLY ACCESS INSTALLATION README

Welcome to the Early Access 1.0 Release of VeriSign's
Trust Gateway. The Trust Gateway is a JavaTM solution 
for securing networked application messaging using 
Web services security standards.

Once you have installed the Trust Gateway, please
refer to the "Trust Gateway Administrator's Guide", 
found under /docs in the installation,
for instructions on configuring and using the Trust 
Gateway.

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

* Windows NT, 2000, or XP
* Solaris 2.8 or 2.9
* Linux Red Hat 7.2

On Linux and Solaris, you must run this Early 
Access version as root user.

INSTALLING THE TRUST GATEWAY SOFTWARE

1. Obtain the latest Trust Gateway installer.

   * If you downloaded the installer, unzip 
     the installer into a temporary directory (TrustGateway 
     in this example).

   * If you are using the CD, place the Trust Gateway CD 
     in your CD drive (D: in this example).

2. Run the appropriate Trust Gateway installer for your
   software platform:

   * On Solaris, run TrustGateway/solaris/setup

   * On Linux, run TrustGateway/linux/setup

   * On Windows, run D:\TrustGateway\Windows\setup.exe

3. Follow the onscreen prompts to install the software:

   * Review the license carefully. You must accept the terms of
     the license to continue. If you do not accept the terms of 
     the license, you must terminate the installation process.

   * Enter a product key (serial number). To install a free,
     60-day evaluation version of the Trust Gateway, leave this
     field blank. To obtain a product key, please contact
     trustgateway@verisign.com

   * Choose an installation directory.

   * Select Installation Options:

     You have the option to install the Trust Gateway Standalone 
     Server and Administration Console, the Trust Gateway toolkit,
     WS-Security component, and, on Windows, a Windows service.

     - The Trust Gateway Server is the stand-alone Trust 
       Gateway component that performs security processing 
       on behalf of the enterprise's applications.

     - The Trust Gateway toolkit includes developer resources. The 
       toolkit also provides tools for testing your installation.
       
     - WS-Security is an emerging standard for securing Web
       Services.  We recommend that you install our implementation.
       See http://www.verisign.com/wss/wss.pdf for more information.

   * If you selected WS-Security, you must accept the terms of the
     license to continue. Read the terms carefully. If you do not 
     accept the terms of the license, you must terminate the 
     installation and install the Trust Gateway without the 
     WS-Security option.

   * Choose an administrator name and password. This identifies 
     the administrator who will configure the Trust Gateway.
     Please be aware that this evaluation version of the Trust Gateway
     supports only a single user. You can change your password in
     Gateway Administration console after you have installed 
     the product.

   * Select an Administration Port. This is the server port you
     will use to login to the Trust Gateway Administration Console.
     The default port is 8776. If this port is in use by another
     application, you will receive a warning. 

The Trust Gateway servlet is now installed.

If you installed as service n Windows, you must restart your
machine before you run the Trust Gateway.

Refer to the README document in the InstallShield  application
for instructions on starting the Trust Gateway and Trust
Gateway Administrator's Console.
